Customer Churn Prediction App
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) a bank using a pre-trained deep learning model. The app takes user input on customer details and returns the churn probability.

ðŸš€ Features
Predicts customer churn based on user inputs.

Utilizes a trained TensorFlow model for prediction.

Encodes and scales inputs using pre-fitted encoders and scalers.

Easy-to-use Streamlit interface.
ðŸ§ª Inputs Required
Geography: Country of the customer (from one-hot encoder categories)

Gender

Age

Credit Score

Balance

Estimated Salary

Tenure: Number of years with the bank

Number of Products

Has Credit Card: 0 or 1

Is Active Member: 0 or 1

ðŸ“Š Output
Churn Probability: A float value between 0 and 1

Churn Decision: Message indicating if the customer is likely to churn

ðŸ§  Model Info
The model was trained using historical bank customer data with features like credit score, geography, age, and account activity. Preprocessing involved label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
All .pkl files (label_encoder_gender.pkl, onehot_encoder_geo.pkl, and scaler.pkl) must be in the same directory as app.py.

The model.h5 file must be present to make predictions.
